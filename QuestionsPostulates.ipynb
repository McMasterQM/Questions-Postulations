    "1. &#x1f3b2; Multiple-Choice Questions. (One or more answers, separated by spaces or commas.)\n",
    "2. &#x1fa99; True/False Questions. (Write True/False.)\n",
    "3. &#x1F5A9; Numerical answers requiring some calculation. (Write the numerical answer in the requested units; significant figures are not checked.)\n",

    "> **Notes:**\n",
    ">- You can upload files to show your mathematical work; you can also type mathematics using Markdown.\n",
    ">- You can use the notebook as a calculator for numerical problems; but you can also just type in your answer computed offline.\n",
    ">- You may find these [sheets containing reference data and mathematical formulas/identities](https://github.com/QC-Edu/IntroQM2022/blob/master/documents/ReferenceConstantsConversionsMath.pdf) useful.\n",
